            <p>Your Four Pillars indicate that you possess a natural ability for strategic planning and decision-making, making you well-suited for careers in finance, consulting, or management. Consider roles such as investment advisor, business strategist, or corporate manager, where your ability to analyze situations and foresee outcomes can be fully utilized.</p>
            <p>Financially, the next decade shows promising growth opportunities, especially through smart investments or business ventures.
