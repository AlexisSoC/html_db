        <div class="section">
            <h2>Business and Financial Luck</h2>
            <p>Your Four Pillars indicate that you have a natural talent for leadership and strategic planning. You are well-suited for careers in business, finance, or management, where your ability to analyze situations and make informed decisions will be highly valued. Consider roles such as financial advisor, business consultant, or project manager, where you can leverage your strengths to achieve success.</p>
            <p>Financially, the next decade presents opportunities for growth through strategic investments or entrepreneurial ventures. However, exercise caution during the fourth and fifth years, as financial fluctuations may occur. Establishing a solid financial plan and seeking advice from experts can help you mitigate risks and capitalize on profitable opportunities.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Career and Academic Success</h2>
            <p>Your career path is likely to involve steady progression and opportunities for leadership. You thrive in environments that challenge your intellect and offer room for innovation. Consider careers in research, technology, or academia, where you can apply your problem-solving skills and analytical thinking.</p>
            <p>Academically, focus on subjects that stimulate your curiosity and encourage critical thinking. Participating in extracurricular activities or joining research groups will provide practical experience and broaden your understanding of complex topics. Your determination and hard work will ensure academic success.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Family and Marriage</h2>
            <p>Your family dynamics may present occasional challenges due to differing viewpoints or expectations. You value independence and personal growth, which can sometimes create tension in family relationships. Open communication and understanding will help you navigate these complexities and build stronger connections.</p>
            <p>In marriage, seek a partner who respects your ambitions and shares your values. Finding a balance between personal aspirations and family commitments will be key to maintaining a healthy relationship.

            <h2>Health and Well-being</h2>
