        <h2>Hexagram Interpretation</h2>
        <p>This hexagram is known as ䷖ (Hexagram 23 - Splitting Apart). It symbolizes decay, disintegration, and the end of a cycle. The hexagram suggests that it is a time of separation and decline, where certain aspects of life may fall apart. It advises letting go of what no longer serves a purpose and allowing change to occur. The hexagram encourages acceptance of the natural process of decay and preparing for new growth in the future.</p>
