        <h2>Hexagram Interpretation</h2>
        <p>This hexagram is known as ䷋ (Hexagram 12 - Standstill). It symbolizes stagnation, obstacles, and a lack of progress. The hexagram suggests that external forces may be causing a standstill or block in efforts. It advises patience and reflection rather than trying to force progress. The best approach is to remain calm, avoid confrontation, and wait for a more favorable time to act. Use this period for self-reflection and planning.</p>
