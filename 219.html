        <h1>Comprehensive Four Pillars of Destiny (SaJu) Reading</h1>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>1. Business and Financial Luck</h2>
            <p>Your financial luck is influenced by the balance of elements in your chart. You possess a strong inclination towards leadership roles, which makes you suitable for managing financial resources or leading a business. However, it is recommended to avoid high-risk investments, especially during the first half of the decade, as Water and Metal elements are in conflict.</p>
            <p><b>Opportunities:</b> Consider exploring fields like technology, finance, or consulting where your analytical skills can be utilized. Real estate and property management could also be lucrative.</p>
            <p><b>Risks:</b> Be cautious of overextending your resources. Collaborate with partners who complement your skill set, particularly those strong in the Earth and Wood elements, to balance your chart.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>2. Career and Academic Success</h2>
            <p>Your chart reveals strong potential for success in careers related to technology, science, or research. You are naturally curious and have a sharp mind, which makes you well-suited for roles that require problem-solving and creativity.</p>
            <p>Focus on fields that allow you to innovate and lead teams, such as project management or product development. Academic pursuits should align with your strengths in analytical thinking and research. Consider pursuing higher education in areas that interest you, such as engineering, economics, or entrepreneurship.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>3. Family and Marriage</h2>
            <p>In relationships, you value harmony and loyalty. There may be occasional conflicts due to your strong-willed nature, but understanding your partner's perspective will help maintain balance. The next decade may bring significant changes in family dynamics, so be adaptable and open to compromise.</p>
            <p>Ideal partners should have complementary elements, such as Earth or Wood, to balance your Metal and Water dominance. Seek someone who shares similar values and life goals to ensure a harmonious relationship.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>4. Health and Well-Being</h2>
            <p>Your health is generally stable, but you should be mindful of stress-related issues, particularly affecting the digestive system and respiratory health. Engaging in regular physical activities such as yoga or swimming can help maintain balance and reduce stress.</p>
            <p>Avoid overworking, and ensure you take time to relax and rejuvenate. A balanced diet with a focus on fresh, natural foods will support your overall well-being.</p>
