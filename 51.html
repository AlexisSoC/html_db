        <div class="section">
            <h2>Business and Financial Luck</h2>
            <p>Your Four Pillars suggest that you have strong analytical skills and a natural talent for strategic planning. Consider exploring careers in finance, consulting, or technology, where your ability to think critically and solve complex problems will be highly valued. Roles such as financial analyst, business consultant, or software engineer may suit you well.</p>
            <p>Financially, the next decade presents several opportunities for growth through calculated investments or entrepreneurial ventures.

            <h2>Family and Marriage</h2>
            <p>Your family dynamics may present occasional challenges, as you value independence and personal growth. Open communication and mutual respect will be essential to maintaining harmony within your relationships.
